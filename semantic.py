# i.e. monkey and cat have a 0.59 similarity as they are both animals, and banana and apple have a 0.66 similarity as they are both fruits.
# Different "types" of words have low similarity - cat and banana and apple and monekey are around 0.22/0.23
# Other relationships are less clear - does monkey and banana have a 0.40 relationship because monkeys are bananas or because they both have 6 letters?

# These words test the hypothesis that the model recognises what animals eat
# A rabbit will eat a leaf, yet the similarity between rabbit and leaf is low, so the model does not seem to recognise this paticular relationship.
# Banana plants have leaves, though, and so the model gives a higher level of similarity at 0.48
